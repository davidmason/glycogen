MATHOGEN TUTORIAL
=================

A simple mathematics tutorial activity for sugar.
Tutorials are only stubs at the moment, but the framework for
displaying tutorials and keeping track of which have been viewed
is functional.

This activity is primarily to contribute to the development
of glycogen's challenge API, as well as to demonstrate the
API and glycogen pathways.

The activity can currently be installed in Sugar by copying
the entire MathogenTute.activity directory into ~/Activities/
and restarting Sugar.
