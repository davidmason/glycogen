MATHOGEN EXAMS
==============

A simple mathematics exam activity for sugar.
The student solves mathematics problems that use the four
basic operators (+, -, *, /) and receive a grade.

This activity is primarily to contribute to the development
of glycogen's activity API, as well as to demonstrate the
API and glycogen pathways.

The activity can currently be installed in Sugar by copying
the entire MathogenExam.activity directory into ~/Activities/
and restarting Sugar.
