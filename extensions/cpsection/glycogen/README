Glycogen as an extension
========================

This represents an early attempt at implementing the glycogen
user interface as an extra view in the home window (the default
views are Favorites View and List View).

It is essentially a hack, dynamically replacing methods in gui
classes while they are running in order to achieve the desired
effect.
One advantage of this is that source code changes are kept
in a single location, the disadvantage is that it is a very
unstable solution, so is definitely not permanent.

I have chosen this approach because it allows me to develop
the necessary methods and classes in a way that is easy to
keep track of, and in a way that is unlikely to do any major
damage to the main source code, so that I don't end up spending
all my time debugging the whole sugar interface when I'm only
interested in one part of it.

Installation
------------
Copy cpsection/glycogen to the same path under the sugar extensions
directory and restart sugar.
