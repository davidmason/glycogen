GLYCOGEN for Sugar
==================

NOTE: This is a project for university credit, but development will continue
      beyond university submission (which will be no later than July, 2011).
      
      I'm currently in the early stages of this project, so don't expect
      to see anything very complete or well defined until closer to submission
      time.


What is glycogen?
-----------------

Glycogen aims to add an extra interface screen to the Sugar desktop environment
(see http://www.sugarlabs.org) which will allow activities to be combined into
learning pathways.

In addition, an API will be defined that activity developers can implement to
allow finer-grained interaction with glycogen, so that learning pathways can
include nodes with specific achievements in addition to the more general
'do this activity' type nodes.


Use with Sugar
--------------

This project's first aim is to develop a proof-of-concept custom release in the
form of a customised 'sugar on a stick' that exists separately to the sugar
project. This is mainly to fit into the time constraints of a university semester
by bypassing (for now) the standard process for becoming involved officially as
a contributor to the project.

A later aim is to have the glycogen project incorporated into sugar's trunk and
to be developed concurrently with sugar (rather than just working with a
snapshot of sugar as the initial release will do).
