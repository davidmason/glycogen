GLYCOGEN LIBRARY CODE
=====================

This code should generally belong in jarabe, or possibly in sugar
but I am keeping it separate for now in order to keep development
simple.

The directory structure within glycogen/ will be kept consistent
with jarabe/, so that copying the contents of glycogen/ to
jarabe/ would put everything in its proper place.
